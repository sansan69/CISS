# CISS Workforce - Feature Roadmap

This document outlines the key features and goals for the next phases of development for the CISS Workforce application.

## 1. Automate Attendance & Ensure Accuracy
Replace manual attendance logs with a fool-proof digital system. By using QR codes, photo capture, and geolocation, you will have undeniable proof of presence, eliminating time theft and disputes.

## 2. Streamline Guard Deployment
Digitize the entire workflow from receiving a client's work order in an Excel file to assigning specific guards to each post. This will provide clarity to field officers, prevent shortages, and ensure client requirements are always met.

## 3. Provide Real-Time Visibility
Give supervisors and management a live dashboard to see which guards are on-site, where they are deployed, and if any shortages have occurred, allowing for immediate action.

## 4. Enhance Field Reliability
By building a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities, your guards can mark attendance reliably even in areas with poor or no internet connectivity. The app will automatically sync the data when a connection is restored.

## 5. Automate Back-Office Functions
Drastically reduce the manual effort for your accounts team. The system will automatically generate accurate data for payroll preparation and client invoicing, directly linking field operations to financial processes.
