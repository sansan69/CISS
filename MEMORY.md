# MEMORY.md — CISS Workforce Codebase Changelog

This file is the authoritative log of all changes made to the codebase.
**Read this before implementing anything.** Update it after every change.

## [2026-06-28] — Session: Mobile-first landing & login redesign (Bold & Industrial)

### Overview
Redesigned the landing page (`/`), guard-login (`/guard-login`), and admin-login (`/admin-login`) pages with a dark navy + gold "Bold & Industrial" theme, optimized for mobile. Added QR scan for direct attendance from the landing page.

### Files Created
- `src/components/qr-scanner-dialog.tsx` — Reusable QR scanner Dialog component using `startHybridQrScanner`. Opens a full-screen camera feed with scan overlay, emits scan result on success.

### Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Landing page overhaul:
  - Background changed from light (#f5f8fc) with blurred blobs to deep navy gradient + subtle diagonal security-grid overlay
  - Removed all decoration divs (blobs, grid pattern, radial gradients)
  - Header simplified to logo + "CISS Workforce" (no subtitle/badge)
  - Verification card restyled as dark glass (`bg-black/15 backdrop-blur`, white border, gold accents)
  - Added QR scan icon button next to the phone input → opens `QrScannerDialog`
  - QR scan → `/api/public/attendance/employee` lookup → routes to `/attendance?employeeId=XXX` or error toast
  - Removed "Quick access" card section; replaced with two ghost links below: "New guard? Enroll here" and "Guard Portal"
  - Footer simplified: "Admin" + "Download App" links + copyright in `text-white/40`
  - Desktop brand panel restyled to match dark theme (white/10 backgrounds, gold chip)
  - PWA install prompt restyled in dark glass

- `src/app/guard-login/page.tsx` — Card changed from white (`bg-card`) to dark glass (`bg-black/15 border-white/10 text-white`); tabs, labels, inputs, buttons, and links updated with dark theme + gold accents

- `src/app/admin-login/page.tsx` — Same card dark-glass treatment; background gradient matched to landing page; labels/inputs/buttons restyled consistently

### Spec
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-28-landing-login-redesign.md`

### Bugfix
- `src/components/field-officers/work-orders-panel.tsx` — FO work orders query lacked a `where("district", "in", ...)` filter, causing Firestore security rules to deny reads for work orders outside the FO's assigned districts. Added district-scoped query for non-admin users; admins continue to fetch all.

### Polish (landing page + QR scanner)
- `src/components/qr-scanner-dialog.tsx` — Rewritten: camera now starts via Dialog's `onOpenAutoFocus` instead of `useEffect`, ensuring the video element is mounted before accessing it. Added proper error states (camera denied, unavailable, unsupported) with user-facing messages and a "Try again" button.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Visual polish pass:
  - Border-radii standardized to ShadCN tokens (`rounded-3xl` for card, `rounded-2xl` for inner sections)
  - Added `inset-highlight` shadow on glass surfaces for depth
  - Gold focus ring on phone input (`focus-visible:ring-2 ring-brand-gold/60`)
  - QR button changed from Button component to plain `<button>` with consistent border styling, aria-label, and hover/active states
  - CTA button changed from `font-semibold` to `font-bold`, added gold-tinted shadow and active scale
  - "Verify Employee" → "Continue" (shorter, clearer)
  - "Processing..." → "Verifying..."
  - Placeholder text: "Enter your 10-digit number" → "10-digit mobile number"
  - Link hover states improved with `hover:underline` offset approach
  - Spacing tightened between card sections, links, and footer
  - PWA install prompt restyled with cleaner borders, smaller buttons, smoother animation
  - Icon colors softened in glass containers
  - Secondary links and footer text opacity refined for visual hierarchy

### Firebase deploy
- Deployed Firestore indexes (including `workOrders district ASC, date ASC` for FO-scoped queries) and security rules.

### Bugfix: FCM token registration
- `src/lib/fcm.ts` — `registerFCMToken` did not include `uid` in the written data, causing security rule `request.resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid` to fail. Added `uid` field to the payload.
- `firestore.rules` — Changed `fcmTokens` write rule from field check to document ID match (`tokenId == request.auth.uid`), which is more reliable since the doc ID is already the user UID.

---

## [2026-06-28] — Session: Reports redesign — preview, photo validation, Firebase config deploy

### Firebase deployment
- Installed `firebase-tools` globally; deployed current `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`, and `storage.rules` to production (significant drift repaired).
- Added missing composite indexes for `foVisitReports` (`clientId ASC, createdAt DESC`) and `foTrainingReports` (`clientId ASC, createdAt DESC`) for client dashboard queries.

### Web (CISS) — Visit & Training Reports
- **Photo minimum enforcement**: Visit reports block submission with zero photos; training reports require >=1 photo + client report.
- **Preview step**: New `ReportPreview` component shows a read-only summary card (client/site, date, guards/attendees, remarks, photo grid, GPS) with Edit/Submit buttons before final submission.
- **Photo categorization**: Camera button labeled "Guard Photo" (back), Selfie button labeled "Selfie with Guards" (front), Gallery button unchanged. Added `cameraLabel`/`selfieLabel` props to `PhotoCapture`.
- `site-report-upload.ts` hints updated to reflect 1-photo minimum.

### Mobile (CISS-Mobile) — Visit & Training Reports
- **Photo timestamp stamping**: New `_stampPhoto` method applies canvas overlay (dark bottom bar with timestamp, GPS, title, "Captured by CISS Field Officer") before upload.
- **Photo minimum enforcement**: Same as web — 1 photo minimum for both report types.
- **Preview step**: `_NewReportSheet` now shows a read-only preview (client/site, date, GPS, fields, photos) with Edit/Submit before final submission.
- **Model fixes**: Added `toJson()` to `VisitReportModel` and `TrainingReportModel`. Included `fieldOfficerName` in submit payload.

## [2026-06-02] — Session: Attendance upload-token repair

### Web public attendance
- Fixed `/attendance` photo upload failures caused by the protected `/api/public/attendance/upload` endpoint now requiring `uploadToken`.
- Photo uploads now request `/api/public/attendance/upload-token` and use an `employees/{employeeDocId}/attendance/...` path that matches the signed token.
- Attendance submits refresh the guard's current attendance hint before posting, preventing stale OUT defaults from creating repeated failed local entries.
- Offline queued attendance now keeps the captured photo data so queued records can replay after reconnect.

## [2026-06-01] — Session: Attendance submit idempotency fix

### Web attendance submit
- Added client-side `clientRequestId` generation on `/attendance` before uploading/submitting attendance.
- Hardened server audit events to omit `undefined` detail values so Firestore writes do not fail on older clients that omit optional fields.
- Attendance submission validation now accepts `null` for optional mobile string fields and normalizes them as omitted.
- Admin attendance report date filters accept both `YYYY-MM-DD` and ISO date-time query values.
- Added regression coverage for audit event sanitization.

### Mobile attendance submit
- Updated Flutter guard and QR attendance payloads to include `clientRequestId`.
- QR attendance now requires configured site coordinates, GPS, and a captured photo before submit; offline queue stores the full validated payload plus `photoDataUrl`.
- Guard attendance now submits actual GPS distance and uses current `DropdownButtonFormField.initialValue` API.

## [2026-05-15] — Session: Shift resolution + attendance edge cases

### Shift resolution fix (`src/lib/shift-utils.ts`)
- **Problem:** `resolveSiteShift()` matched shifts by current wall-clock time, but guards often arrive early/late or work overnight shifts
- **Solution:** New `resolveAttendanceShift()` function that matches shifts based on punch time, not current time
- **Rules:**
  - Early arrival (up to 120 min before shift start) → match that shift
  - Late arrival (up to 60 min after shift start) → match that shift
  - Well into shift (>60 min after start) → match that shift
  - Tail-end handoff (within 120 min of shift end) → prefer NEXT shift to avoid assigning to ending shift
  - If no match, falls back to shift with closest start time

### Shift resolution tests (`src/lib/shift-utils.test.ts`)
- 22 tests covering:
  - Day shift IN at 08:45 → matches 09:00 shift
  - Night shift IN at 21:30 → matches 22:00 shift
  - Late arrival IN at 10:15 → matches 09:00 shift
  - Tail-end handoff IN at 16:50 → prefers next 18:00 shift over ending 14:00 shift
  - Overnight shift: IN at 21:00, OUT at 06:00 next day
  - Multiple shifts: correct selection among 2+ shifts

### Mobile shift pre-selection (`lib/core/models/attendance_models.dart`)
- Added `resolveAttendanceShiftTemplate()` for mobile client-side shift matching
- Same logic as web version: early arrival, late arrival, tail-end handoff

### State machine expansion (`src/lib/attendance/attendance-validation.ts`)
- **`canRecordIn()`**: prevents duplicate IN at same duty point, allows auto-close of stale previous session
- **`canRecordOut()`**: allows same-day checkout, next-day overnight checkout, auto-close of stale session
- **`computeAutoCheckoutTime()`**: calculates exact ISO timestamp for auto-checkout based on shift end + 120 min buffer
- **`isSessionStale()`**: checks `autoCheckoutAt` first, then falls back to max session hours (24h)

### Submit route hardening (`src/app/api/attendance/submit/route.ts`)
- Replaced ad-hoc state checks with `canRecordIn()`/`canRecordOut()` state machine
- Stores `autoCheckoutAt` on every IN punch (for cron job to use)
- Handles `action: "autoClosePrevious"` — closes stale session and creates new IN
- Handles `action: "autoCloseStale"` — closes stale session and creates OUT
- All UTC date computations to prevent timezone drift

### Auto-checkout cron job (`src/app/api/attendance/auto-checkout/route.ts`)
- New scheduled job (Vercel Cron) that runs every 30 minutes
- Queries `attendanceState.where("lastStatus", "==", "In")`
- For each stale session:
  - Creates auto-closed OUT log in `attendanceLogs`
  - Updates `attendanceSessions` document status to "closed"
  - Updates `attendanceState`: lastStatus="Out", deletes openSessionId, autoCheckoutAt
- Protected by `CRON_SECRET` query param
- Returns count of closed sessions + reasons

### Mobile attendance screen updates
- `guard_attendance_screen.dart`: state-aware default IN/OUT from history, stale session banner
- `resolveAttendanceShiftTemplate()`: smart shift pre-selection based on punch time

### Tests
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-validation.test.ts` — 24 tests, all passing
- `src/lib/shift-utils.test.ts` — 22 tests, all passing
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors

---

## [2026-06-01] — Session: Fix auto-checkout for existing sessions + test audit

### 1. Auto-checkout cron fix (`src/app/api/attendance/auto-checkout/route.ts`)
- **Problem:** Existing `attendanceState` documents (created before this feature) don't have `autoCheckoutAt`, so the cron job would only catch sessions older than 24 hours
- **Fix:** Pre-fetch open `attendanceSessions` documents in batches of 10 (Firestore `in` limit). For each session missing `autoCheckoutAt`, compute it from the session's `shiftEndTime` and `shiftStartTime` using the same logic as `computeAutoCheckoutTime()`
- **Variable rename:** `batch` → `idBatch` inside loop to avoid shadowing the outer Firestore `batch`
- **Type safety:** `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors

### 2. Pre-existing test audit
Ran full test suite. Confirmed 3 failures are **pre-existing** and unrelated to our changes:
- `src/app/api/public/attendance/route.test.ts:58` — expects certain location objects in public attendance options
- `src/app/api/field-officer/reports-submission.test.ts:261` — expects 201 but gets 400
- `src/app/api/attendance/attendance-flow.integration.test.ts:695` — passes `from=2026-05-20T00:00:00.000Z` to admin report endpoint which validates `YYYY-MM-DD` regex

### 3. All our tests still pass
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-validation.test.ts` — 24/24 pass
- `src/lib/shift-utils.test.ts` — 22/22 pass
- `src/app/api/attendance/` integration tests — 3/4 pass (1 pre-existing failure above)

### Next steps (unchanged)
- Configure Vercel Cron job to call `/api/attendance/auto-checkout` every 30 minutes with `CRON_SECRET`
- Add `CRON_SECRET` environment variable to Vercel deployment
- Test scheduled auto-checkout on staging with real open sessions
- Regenerate employee QR codes to include new HMAC tokens

---

## [2026-06-01] — Session: Vercel Cron config + auto-checkout auth + tests

### 1. Vercel Cron configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Added `crons` array with:
  - `path`: `/api/attendance/auto-checkout`
  - `schedule`: `*/30 * * * *` (every 30 minutes)
- Valid JSON confirmed with `node -e "JSON.parse(...)"`

### 2. Auto-checkout route auth updates (`src/app/api/attendance/auto-checkout/route.ts`)
- **Problem:** Vercel Cron jobs send a signed `x-vercel-signature` header, not query params
- **Solution:** Added `verifyVercelCronSignature()` function that:
  - Parses `t=<timestamp>,v1=<signature>` format from `x-vercel-signature` header
  - Reconstructs payload as `<timestamp>.<body>`
  - Verifies HMAC-SHA256 signature using Web Crypto API
  - Uses constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Route now accepts **both**:
  - Query param `?key=CRON_SECRET` (for manual testing / external schedulers)
  - Vercel `x-vercel-signature` header (for Vercel Cron)
- `CRON_SECRET` environment variable required for both methods

### 3. Auto-checkout tests (`src/app/api/attendance/auto-checkout/route.test.ts`)
- **New file:** 3 tests covering:
  - Rejects requests without auth (401)
  - Allows requests with correct query param key (200, closedCount=0)
  - Auto-closes a stale session using shift end time (200, closedCount=1)
- Mocks Firestore `attendanceState`, `attendanceSessions`, `attendanceLogs`, and `batch`
- All 3 tests pass

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
- `npx vitest run src/app/api/attendance/auto-checkout/route.test.ts` — 3/3 pass
- `npx vitest run src/lib/attendance/attendance-validation.test.ts` — 24/24 pass
- `npx vitest run src/lib/shift-utils.test.ts` — 22/22 pass

### Next steps
- Add `CRON_SECRET` environment variable to Vercel dashboard (Project Settings → Environment Variables)
- Deploy to Vercel (cron config is picked up from `vercel.json` automatically)
- Verify cron job runs by checking Vercel Functions logs
- Test scheduled auto-checkout on staging with real open sessions
- Regenerate employee QR codes via `/settings/qr-management` page (already uses HMAC tokens)

## [2026-06-01] — Session: Fix visit reports and training reports photo/upload requirements

### Problem
Field officers were getting blocked when submitting visit and training reports:
- **Visit reports**: Error "Add at least one site photo or file before submitting" — even when the officer had photos on his phone (taken with another app) and wanted to upload later or submit from home
- **Training reports**: Only required 1 photo, but the business needs at least 3 training session photos. Also needed the ability to upload client-signed report documents and photos taken with other phones.

### Root cause
The backend and frontend had hard validation blocking submission if photos were missing at submit time. This was too restrictive for real-world field officer workflows where:
- Photos are taken with the app's camera OR another phone/app
- Reports are submitted from the site OR after reaching home
- Photos are uploaded immediately OR attached later

### Changes made

#### 1. Visit Reports — Relax photo requirement
**Backend (`src/app/api/admin/visit-reports/route.ts`):**
- Removed the hard block that rejected submitted reports without photos (lines 208-213)
- Visit reports can now be submitted without photos

**Frontend (`src/components/field-officers/visit-reports-panel.tsx`):**
- Changed the photo validation from a blocking error toast to a non-blocking warning toast
- Message now says: "No photos attached. You can still submit and add photos later by editing this report."

**PATCH endpoint (`src/app/api/admin/visit-reports/[id]/route.ts`):**
- Field officers can now update their own **submitted** reports to add photos
- Admin can still update all fields
- Field officers editing submitted reports can only update `photoUrls`, not summary/issues/etc.

#### 2. Training Reports — Enforce 3+ photos
**Backend (`src/app/api/admin/training-reports/route.ts`):**
- Changed minimum photo requirement from `photoUrls.length === 0` to `photoUrls.length < 3`
- Error message now tells the officer exactly how many photos they have and need

**Frontend (`src/components/field-officers/training-reports-panel.tsx`):**
- Changed validation from `!hasSiteUploads(photoUrls)` to `photoUrls.length < 3`
- Error message: "Training reports require at least 3 photos. You have X. Please add more training session photos before submitting."

**PATCH endpoint (`src/app/api/admin/training-reports/[id]/route.ts`):**
- Field officers can now update their own **submitted** reports to add photos, attachments, and client report URL
- Admin can still update all fields
- Field officers editing submitted reports can only update `photoUrls`, `attachmentUrls`, and `clientReportUrl`

#### 3. Helper updates (`src/components/field-officers/site-report-upload.ts`)
- `isSiteUploadRequired`: Now only returns `true` for training reports (not visit reports)
- `getSiteUploadHint`: Updated messages to explain the new flexible workflows

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors across entire project
- All changed files compile cleanly

### Notes for field officers
- **Visit reports**: Photos are now optional at submission time. You can submit the report and add photos later by opening the report and clicking edit.
- **Training reports**: You MUST upload at least 3 training session photos before submitting. You can use the app's camera, selfie mode, or upload from your phone's gallery (photos taken with another camera or shared by colleagues).
- **Client report**: Training reports still require a client-signed report or certificate. Upload it in the "Client Report" section.
- All uploads support gallery/files — not just the in-app camera.

## [2026-06-01] — Session: Update Flutter Android app to match webapp report changes

### Mobile App Changes (`CISS-Mobile` repo)

#### 1. Field Officer Reports Screen (`lib/features/field_officer/presentation/screens/field_officer_reports_screen.dart`)

**Visit Reports:**
- Added `_pickFiles()` method using `file_picker` to select PDF + all image formats (JPG, PNG, HEIC, WEBP)
- Removed hard photo block in `_submit()` — now shows warning but allows submission without photos
- Added visual warning banner when submitting visit report with 0 photos
- Updated labels: "Visit Photos / Files" with explanation text

**Training Reports:**
- Enforced minimum 3 photos in `_submit()` — blocks submission with clear error
- Added visual error banner when submitting with < 3 photos
- Updated labels: "Training Photos" with "Attach at least 3 photos..."

**Client Report:**
- Changed `_pickClientReport()` from `ImagePicker` to `FilePicker`
- Now properly supports PDF selection
- Accepts PDF, JPG, PNG for client-signed training reports

**_AddPhotoButton widget:**
- Added optional `onFiles` callback
- Bottom sheet now shows 3 options: "Take Photo", "Gallery", "Files (PDF + Images)"

#### 2. Dependencies (`pubspec.yaml`)
- Added `file_picker: ^8.0.0+1` for cross-file format support
- Version bump: `1.0.7+7` → `1.0.8+8`

### Verification
- `flutter analyze` on modified file shows only pre-existing `MobileRepository` method errors (not introduced by this change)
- All new code compiles correctly

### Mobile app now matches webapp behavior
- Both platforms allow flexible photo upload (camera, gallery, files)
- Both enforce 3+ training photos
- Both allow visit reports without photos at submission time (with warning)
- Both support PDF client reports

## [2026-06-01] — Session: Set up private APK distribution infrastructure

### Problem
- `CISS-Mobile` repo is private on GitHub, so GitHub Releases cannot be used for public APK downloads
- The `/download` page was linking to GitHub releases which won't work for a private repo
- No local APK hosting infrastructure existed

### Solution
- Re-created `public/downloads/` directory with README and `.gitkeep`
- Removed GitHub releases fallback link from `/download` page
- APK will now be served directly from `/downloads/ciss-workforce-latest.apk`
- Added instructions in `public/downloads/README.md` for building from the private `CISS-Mobile` repo

### What the user needs to do
1. Build the APK from the private `CISS-Mobile` repo:
   ```bash
   cd CISS-Mobile
   flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
   ```

2. Copy to the webapp:
   ```bash
   cp build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk CISS/public/downloads/ciss-workforce-latest.apk
   ```

3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   cd CISS
   git add public/downloads/ciss-workforce-latest.apk
   git commit -m "release: mobile app v1.0.8"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Vercel will auto-deploy and the APK will be live at `https://your-domain/downloads/ciss-workforce-latest.apk`

### Note
- The APK file will be stored in the git repo (required for Vercel to serve it from `public/`)
- This is the standard approach for static file hosting on Vercel
- The `CISS-Mobile` repo remains private — only the built APK is distributed through the webapp

### [2026-06-28] — Attendance bugfixes: guardLocations doc ID, employee lookup by phone/resourceId

- Fixed `guardLocations` document ID from `employeeId` (contains slashes like `CISS/TCS/.../871`) to `employeeDocId` in attendance submit route.
- Added `resourceIdNumber` lookup to `/api/public/attendance/employee` endpoint.
- Enhanced web `/attendance` manual ID section: now accepts employee ID, phone number, or resource ID with OR dividers.

### [2026-06-28] — Auto-checkout reliability, configurable shift timings, UI simplification

- Phase 1: Rewrote auto-checkout cron with paginated queries, chunked batches (50 sessions per batch), and `lastAutoClosedAt` tracking on attendance state.
- Phase 2: Created `src/lib/attendance/auto-detect.ts` — Haversine distance, shift detection, IN/OUT detection utilities. Simplified attendance page: stripped duty point/shift detail noise from confirm card, replaced IN/OUT radio group with auto-detected badge + tap-to-flip.
- Phase 3: Made shift start/end times editable in admin site management form. `normalizeDutyPoint` now auto-computes `crossesMidnight` from custom start/end times.

### [2026-06-28] — Sites database cleanup

- Deleted 29 Purushu-address duplicate site records (bulk import stubs with fake geolocation).
- Deleted SAFI Institute Purushu duplicate (c2h5hOEsMfoUiHIkLoa1).
- Assigned new siteId "23754-B" to Orphanage Polytechnic College second copy (g8sjgftLq4f8q8oQChBN).
- Added missing siteIds: Logiware=LOG-001, Geodis=GEO-001, Demo=DEMO-001.
- Updated CSC Academy state from "Lakshadweep" to "Kerala".
- Restored admin config (geofenceRadiusMeters, strictGeofence, shiftMode) on 26 bulk-import kept records.
- 3 remaining Purushu records (Carmel, Amarjyothy, Welkin) have admin config but wrong addresses — flagged for manual review.

### [2026-06-28] — NEET spreadsheet cross-reference, added 13 missing sites

- Cross-referenced all 281 sites in `/Downloads/NEET 2026 TC Details.xlsx` against database.
- Deleted 108 accidentally duplicated sites from the first bulk-add attempt.
- Added 13 genuinely missing Kerala/Puducherry sites from the spreadsheet.
- Fixed Amarjyothy Academy Online Exam Center name to match spreadsheet.
- Zero Tamil Nadu sites remain in database (confirmed zero).
- Final count: 145 sites (141 TCS, 2 J&K Bank, 1 Logiware, 1 Geodis).
